        <p>
          This parrot species is rather unknown, and is originally from the west
          of Africa. This little buddy is a popular pet choice in its area for a
          good reason, they are a quiet and calm parrot species. Is only 9.1
          inches long, so they fit comfortably in a small cage; despite this,
          give them enough space and toys to exercise their wings and beaks.
          They can live up to 50 years in captivity, but wild Senegal parrots
          don't get to be good pets as they are not easy to tame; therefore,
          acquire a Senegal parrot born in captivity.

        <p>
          Cockatiels are a member of the cockatoo family, is one of the most
          popular parrots in the United States, and is perfect for the first
          time parrot owner. Cockatiels can be from 12 to 13 inches, the
          smallest from the cockatoo‚Äôs family. A distinctive trait of them is
          their erectile crest. By watching the cockatiel‚Äôs crest we can learn
          their emotional state; a completely erect crest means your cockatiel
          is startled or excited, while a completely flat crest means the animal
          is angry or defensive.

          The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional
          British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, dense coat,
          and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British
          Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, orange eyes, and a medium-sized
          tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other
          colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.
